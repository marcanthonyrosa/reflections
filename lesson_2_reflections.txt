Question:
What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Answer:
Git needs to know where to start saving git commands and where to begin a repository. When you initialize a repository, git creates a file called .git that's hidden.

Question:
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Answer:
The staging area allows users to collect related changes together in a way that might be different than the rest of the working directory or repository. For example, I may want to log changes of a few files separately from a set of other files. The staging area gives me this control.
