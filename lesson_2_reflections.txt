Question:
What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Question:
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Answer:
The staging area allows users to collect related changes together in a way that might be different than the rest of the working directory or repository. For example, I may want to log changes of a few files separately from a set of other files. The staging area gives me this control.

Question:
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Answer:
The staging area is a great way to isolate specific changes in buckets, and then commit them one at a time.

Question:
What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

Answer:
Branches are EXTREMELY helpful when thinking about deviating from the core project in a material way. This could include working on a major (or minor) feature, or when thinking about experiments or other interesting projects. Branches help by making it easy to try new things without risking the core code.
