Question:
When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Answer:
I'd want to use a remote repository for a few reasons! Firstly, when I'm working on a project with other users, it's helpful to have my files saved on a remote repository. Secondly, having a remote repository makes it easier to work on files between multiple computers (perhaps a work computer and a personal computer!).

Question:
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Answer:
You might want to always pull changes manually because you might be working on code that references a previous branch. As well, if Git automatically stayed up-to-date, it might be possible that new code would be introduced without knowing it, adding to confusion and adding in disruptions to your coding flow.
