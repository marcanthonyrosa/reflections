Question:
When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Answer:
I'd want to use a remote repository for a few reasons! Firstly, when I'm working on a project with other users, it's helpful to have my files saved on a remote repository. Secondly, having a remote repository makes it easier to work on files between multiple computers (perhaps a work computer and a personal computer!).
